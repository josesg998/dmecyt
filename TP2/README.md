In this project, my team and I pursued an thorough analysis of brain neurons in the different stages of sleep. For that purpose we pursued a graph analysis, detecting the importance of different neurons and regions of the brain. We also applied the neuron classification done in Tagliazucchi (2013), in which we detected hubs and non-hubs neurons. Finally, we applied a community detection algorithm to detect the different communities of neurons in the brain.
